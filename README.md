# Azure OpenAI Sora Image Generator Example
This example takes command line arguments to generate videos using a Azure OpenAI Sora model and saves them to a ./outputs/ folder.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up, ensure you have the following:
* Azure subscription: Required to set up services
* miniconda: Installed and the command "conda" works because it's been added to your PATH
* Python 3.11 conda environment: There should be an existing Python 3.11 environment called ai-gbb-workshop.
* Azure CLI: Installed and configured


## 2. Environment Setup

### 2.1 Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com//rashedtalukder/azure-sora-demo.git
```

### 2.2 Load Conda Environment and Install Required Python Packages
```bash
conda activate sora_demo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the included SDK separately
```bash
pip install -e ./rashed_sora_sdk
cd ..
```

### 2.3 Configure Environment Variables
Rename and modify the **sample.env** file or create a new `.env` file in the root of your project and add the parameters below, filling out individual fields accordingly:
```env
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://{{YOUR_AI_PROJECT_RESOURCE_NAME}}.services.ai.azure.com"
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="{{YOUR AOAI KEY}}
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="{{MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}}"
AZURE_AI_API_VERSION="2025-02-15-preview"
```

## 3. Generate a video
This application simply calls the endpoint for generating a video. There are only a few available image sizes that are supported and maximum duration of 20 seconds. Read more of the constraints in the SDK's README in the **rashed_sora_sdk** folder.

### 3.1 Run the example
The example takes arguments from your terminal. To generate a video, issue the command
```bash
python examples/cli.py --prompt="A Chihuahua eating a taco on a counter in a Mexican-American Fast Food Chain restaurant"
```

### 3.2 Open the generated and downloaded video
Go to the **outputs** folder and view the .mp4 video file. There is also a gif that's generated.

### 3.3 Other configurations
To see what are the other available configuration arguments that the example can take, use
```bash
python examples/cli.py --help
```

## 4. Generate a video via Chainlit GUI
Using just a few lines of code, we can get a frontend up for our LLM application thanks to the Chainlit library. All of the application executes via event hooks that the library provides. You can read about those events in the [Chainlit API reference](https://docs.chainlit.io/api-reference/lifecycle-hooks/on-chat-start).

### 4.1 Run the Chainlit example
To run the example use the Chainlit CLI in terminal. The `-w` arguement watches for any changes in the code and reloads the application so you don't need to restart during development:
```bash
chainlit run examples/gui.py -w
```

Then go to **[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)" in your browser and enter a prompt for the video that you want to generate. It'll take a few seconds to generate it.
